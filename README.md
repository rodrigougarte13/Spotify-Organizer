# Spotify playlist creator & Visualizations

Born out of my passion for music and inspired by Spotify Wrapped, this project began with the goal of organizing my music collection into meaningful playlists. Leveraging the Spotify API, I retrieved all my liked songs and initially attempted clustering to create playlists, though initial results were limited, possibly due to needing more features for accurate clustering. I pivoted to grouping playlists by genre, successfully curating around 12 cohesive playlists from my collection. Additionally, I developed a personalized Spotify Wrapped dashboard that visualizes my music listening habits over time. This dashboard highlights trends in my listening preferences, showcasing periods of intense music exploration and identifying favorite artists and tracks in a graphical format. My favorite visualizatons was the pie chart that shows my favorite genres, and using the slider to see how that varied with each year was truly rewarding.
